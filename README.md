# Data in Motion
### A living, interactive view of real-life data

The path of a scientist generates tons of data that sometimes don't get the
attention they deserve; even when the data is analyzed, it frequently gets put
in a static graph that limits the depth of the story that it can tell. This
repository holds a workflowr-powered website that presents data I either sourced
or generated in my work in an interactive fashion. The goal is to provide a
behind-the-scene look at the data analysis involved in science, and make all of
my data more accessible to all audiences.
